# GrazyGolf (2022 Group 03 Golf game)
This program is a putting simulation program, which capture all the excitement of the real-life putting experience from the comfort of your room. The program approximate the physics of real-life putting, and allow for players to play against each other or an artificial intelligence player (bot). The program also allow players to create their own putting greens, complete with rolling hills, obstacles and lakes. 

In our programe there are artificial intelligence players capable of playing on the terrain you create. The best bot can not only consistently manage to score a hole-in-one, where possible, but also avoid obstacles, and handle complex, maze-like courses.
